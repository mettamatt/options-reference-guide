# Options Reference Guide
The inspiration for this came from a screenshot of an old [Series 7 exam prep](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/series7.asp).

This is a beginner-friendly guide to understanding options in the financial market. This guide covers the basic terminologies used in options trading and discusses the concepts of option moneyness, option positions (long and short) for both calls and puts, and some important terms used in trading.
